        <p>
            I spent the majority of my high school years volunteering on Houston Methodist on the orthopedic floor. This
            experience is particularly important to me because it was my first time dedicating my time to something
            that's bigger than myself, the health of other people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Initially I signed up my first year to score some volunteer hours and at the time I was considering becoming
            a medical doctor. Wanting to see how the hospital environment is like, I volunteered there. Sometimes I
            would be grouped with another volunteer but most days would consist of me helping to clean rooms, help
            patients in and out of bed, answering calls for nurse station, and other mundane tasks. The most memorable
            part of my time there was talking to the patients. People who ended up on this floor were generally old and
            in pretty bad shape but most would recover ok. After sometime the patients would recognize my face and
            remember my name and in my down time I would visit their rooms and listen to them tell stories of their
            lives as they got comfortable with me. Something that stood out to me was how open and honest people
            patients generally were on that floor. I still remember helping this one guy out of bed to get to the
            bathroom, and he was in so much pain after making a little movement. As we were taking a break he was
            telling
            me about how he used to serve in the military and was a Vietnam veteran. He told me about things he was
            upset about and happy about during his service and passed on some wise words that seemed to not sound cheesy
            at all at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is difficult to accurately tell my experience through words, but helping people from many walks of life
            during a vulnerable moment in their lives helped me mature in some ways I wouldn't have grown in otherwise.
